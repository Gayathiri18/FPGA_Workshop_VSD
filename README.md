Instructor Profile:
Dr. Nanditha Rao is an Assistant Professor in the VLSI Systems group at IIIT Bangalore. She obtained her PhD in Electrical Engineering from IIT, Bombay in 2017. Her current research interests are in the area of processor architecture, RISC-V based designs, FPGA based designs, FPGA based acceleration of neural networks and radiation tolerant/hardened designs. Prior to joining for PhD, she worked as a Hardware design engineer (mainly Signal Integrity) at Intel Technologies, Bangalore for a period of 5+ years. At Intel, she was mainly responsible for signal integrity simulations of motherboard interconnects for high-speed differential interfaces such as pci-express, LVDS, DisplayPort, HDMI and so on. She interacted with customers in the Asia Pacific region on motherboard design guidelines and specialized in buffer modeling.
